## 3. Choose One User Story and Break It Down into Tasks 

### **User Story:**  
*As a player, I want to collect items and power-ups to enhance my abilities.*

#### **Tasks Breakdown**
1. **Design & Concept** – Decide on power-up types and their effects.
2. **Asset Creation** – Draw power-up icons and animations.
3. **Code Implementation**
    - Create a power-up class.
    - Implement logic for spawning power-ups.
    - Implement collision detection with the player.
    - Apply power-up effects to the player.
4. **Testing & Balancing** – Ensure power-ups work as intended and are not too overpowered.
5. **Bug Fixing & Polishing** – Address any issues found during testing.

## 4. Discuss with Another Team 
Compare stakeholders, epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria with another team. Questions to discuss:

 - Are we missing any stakeholders?
 - Do our user stories cover the full gameplay experience?
 - Are our acceptance criteria detailed enough?
 - What did the other team do differently that we can learn from?

### **Utility of This Exercise:**
 - Ensures every aspect of the game is considered.
 - Helps in planning development efficiently.
 - Makes it easier to track progress.
 - Improves communication within the team.
