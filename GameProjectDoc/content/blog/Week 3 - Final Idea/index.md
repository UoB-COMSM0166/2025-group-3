The game, currently untitled, is a 2D puzzle platformer where players control both a cat and a toast, which can combine to form "Cato" and fly freely. Players must solve puzzles across various stages by utilizing the distinct movement abilities of both characters, including triggers, movable walls, tubes, sponges, and climbable walls to navigate and clear each level.
