<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation, RPG<br>
A charming farming simulator where players inherit a rundown farm and work to restore it. Alongside managing crops and livestock, the game features social interactions, exploration, and an optional combat system.<br>
<strong>Success Factors:</strong><br>
The combination of relaxing farm management with engaging social dynamics, exploration, and occasional combat offers a versatile and immersive experience.<br>
<strong>Core Gameplay:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Farm Management:</strong> Grow crops, raise animals, and maintain your farm with attention to seasonal changes.</li>
<li><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Develop relationships with townsfolk, attend festivals, and explore character-driven storylines.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration and Adventure:</strong> Mine for resources, fight creatures, and uncover hidden secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Budget your time and energy to balance farming, social, and adventure pursuits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map Management:</strong> The expansive world of Stardew Valley can cause performance issues, especially with large farms and numerous NPCs.</li>
<li><strong>NPC AI:</strong> Crafting detailed AI behavior, including NPC schedules and story progression, can be resource-heavy for a browser-based experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feasible Implementation Scope:</strong><br>
Focus on the farming and social elements, with minimal emphasis on combat or large-scale exploration.</p>
